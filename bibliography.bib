  abstract     = {The use of Building Information Management (BIM) has become mainstream in many countries. Exchanging data in open standards like the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is seen as the only workable solution for collaboration. To define information needs for collaboration, many organizations are now documenting what kind of data they need for their purposes. Currently practitioners define their requirements often a) in a format that cannot be read by a computer; b) by creating their own definitions that are not shared. This paper proposes a bottom up solution for the definition of new building concepts a property. The authors have created a prototype implementation and will elaborate on the capturing of information specifications in the future.},

	abstract = {Today, with many of the technological issues of integrated information management resolved (perhaps excluding the matter of interoperability), defining the content and status of BIM information deliveries remains both a practical and a theoretical problem. New BIM tools and new design processes and procedures have led to a certain confusion of what information is needed for particular BIM uses. This paper seeks to explore and enable a method of defining the content of model information deliverables through a review of 2 key primary specific BIM uses: 3d Design Coordination and Early Energy Appraisal through an analysis of practical application. The scope of this study is limited to a review of information flow within residential projects in a Swedish context and looks at two projects with a view to identify and establish a common definition of the key BIM objects and properties necessary for particular tasks. The key deliverable from this study is the BIM-Info Delivery Protocol (IDP) which attempts to align consultant BIM-information delivery expectations and represents a tangible solution to assist consultants to manage BIM information. Concluding reflections consider the positioning of the IDP relative to the on-going development of IDMs / MVDs and highlight the key constituent parameters of an Information Delivery Specification (IDS).},

Due to the high dependencies among the disciplines, this information must be carefully checked. While semi-automatic methods for checking geometric information exist, the validation of semantic information is often done manually and document-based causing errors and an inefficient, laborious collaboration process. In order to create an expert system for BIM-based factory design through automatic checking of semantic information, this paper lays the corresponding foundation regarding (i) domain-specific validation rules and (ii) software implementation possibilities by using a two-round Delphi study.}

We examine five major industrial efforts in detail, all relying on IFC building models as input. The functional capabilities of a rule checking system are organized into four stages; these functional criteria provide a framework for comparisons of the five systems. The review assesses both the technology and structure of building design rule checking, as an assessment of this new emerging field. The development of rule checking systems for building is very young and only limited user experience is presented. The survey lays out a framework for considering research needed for this area to mature.}

	abstract = {Code compliance checking plays a critical role that identifies substandard designs according to regulatory documents and promises the accuracy of the designs before construction. However, the traditional code compliance checking process relies heavily on human work. To help the users better understand the checking process, this study proposes a gray-box checking technique and a BIM-based (Building Information Modeling)automated code compliance checking methodology that leverages ontology. The proposed approach contains a code ontology, a designed model ontology, a merged ontology, a code compliance checking ontology, a set of mapping rules, and a set of checking rules. During the checking process, the ontologies provide knowledge bases, and the rules provide necessary logic. A five-step roadmap is proposed for code ontology development for domain experts. For the time being, pre-processing is applied to create the designed model ontology to achieve time saving. Next, an ontology mapping procedure between the code and the designed model ontology is executed to obtain the merged ontology. In the ontology mapping procedure, the mapping rules aim to mitigate the semantic ambiguity between design information and regulatory information and enrich building information's semantics. Subsequently, rule-based reasoning is applied based on the checking rules and the merged ontology for checking reports generation. Finally, according to Chinese building codes, an automated code compliance checking platform is implemented for real construction projects to validate the proposed methodology.}

	abstract = {BIM-based rule checking systems are helpful for identifying potential concerns and flaws during the building design process. Currently, there is a lack of useful user interfaces for flexible rule manipulations and better tractability of the design intentions when rule violations occurred. This study aims to develop a BIM-based rule checking interface for users to address: (1) the current inflexible laborious coding process of rules, and (2) the low capability to describe rule influence comprehensively on the model designs. A research question is raised that whether the design adjustments against rule violations, such as making BIM elements changed, can be further traced their influence by an interface to prevent derived violations. A two-layered logic-based rule evaluation interface is developed to establish the rules aimed at meeting users' needs, and to identify design dependency topologically related to the involved BIM elements. A case study with a partial 7-story building section is used to evaluate the interface, and results show that the dependency between rule violations and their affected BIM elements can be successfully retrieved. It helps users to make the adjustment and identify influences of design changes to avoid further derived rule violations. A future direction of the study is capability evaluations for typical building engineers and architects to translate their design intentions and local rules by using the proposed interface with real building projects.}

	abstract = {Despite the potentially significant benefits that Building Information Modeling (BIM) can offer during a facility's operation and maintenance (O&M) phase, the construction industry has thus far mainly implemented BIM in the design and construction phases. This is because even though as-built BIM models are delivered at the handover stage, owners and operators rarely have the expertise to efficiently use and update them. Additionally, industry standards do not provide precise guidelines on aspects such as the ease of use, interoperability, and maintainability of FM-BIM, that could ensure their efficient and effective utilization. Moreover, given that these models are mainly developed for the design and construction phases, they usually contain design and construction details that are not useful for the building's operation and maintenance or lack information required for this phase. Thus, this paper investigates correspondences between as-built models and O&M requirements, using procedures and semi-automated tools to facilitate quality management activities for FM-BIM. To achieve this, a detailed checklist of items that are required in the BIM models at the handover stage and of the items that can be purged was created. This checklist is part of an overall quality framework that includes quality assurance and quality control tasks to deliver useable models for the operation and maintenance phase. Additionally, a procedure and a set of tools were investigated to semi-automatically apply a collection of the items of the checklist on as-built models. A process flow is presented to assist in quality management activities during the development of the models and to prepare them for handover. Finally, two case studies were conducted to verify and validate the applicability of the developed tools and proposed procedures.}

	abstract = {As more and more architectural design and construction data is represented using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) data model, it makes sense to take advantage of the logical basis of RDF and implement a semantic rule checking process as it is currently not available in the architectural design and construction industry. The argument for such a semantic rule checking process has been made a number of times by now. However, there are a number of strategies and approaches that can be followed regarding the realization of such a rule checking process, even when limiting to the use of semantic web technologies. In this article, we compare three reference rule checking approaches that have been reported earlier for semantic rule checking in the domain of architecture, engineering and construction (AEC). Each of these approaches has its advantages and disadvantages. A criterion that is tremendously important to allow adoption and uptake of such semantic rule checking approaches, is performance. Hence, this article provides an overview of our collaborative test results in order to obtain a performance benchmark for these approaches. In addition to the benchmark, a documentation of the actual rule checking approaches is discussed. Furthermore, we give an indication of the main features and decisions that impact performance for each of these three approaches, so that system developers in the construction industry can make an informed choice when deciding for one of the documented rule checking approaches.}

	abstract = {Building environmental monitoring and compliance checking are important in ensuring environmental performance. The information required for monitoring and checking is obtained from different data sources in different information systems. In this context, information sharing between stakeholders and the semantic interoperability that prevails with varying information systems are necessary. However, the implementation of information sharing and semantic interoperability can be a challenge. This paper proposes an ontology-based framework to support environmental monitoring and compliance checking under building information modeling (BIM) environment among different information systems. The framework integrates building information from BIM, environmental information provided by sensors, and regulatory information based on building regulations and design requirements. In this framework, four specific ontologies are developed to represent relevant knowledge. Building information is extracted from BIM and then converted, together with environmental information provided by sensors, into resource description framework format as ontology instances. The regulation clauses are transformed into SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) rules. A case study is performed to apply the framework, and environmental monitoring and automated compliance checking are implemented in the context of a real distributed energy station project. The testing results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework.}
